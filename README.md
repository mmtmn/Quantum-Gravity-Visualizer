# Quantum Gravity Visualizer

This Python script is using Pygame and NumPy to visualize a 3D wave function. It simulates particles influenced by gravity and visualizes them in 2D. Here's a brief review:


Wave Function: Defines a 3D Gaussian wave function. It's complex-valued, representing quantum mechanical wave functions.


Probability Density: Calculates the probability density from the wave function, important in quantum mechanics for finding the likelihood of particle positions.


Gravity and Collision: Simulates a basic physics environment with gravity and floor collision.


3D to 2D Projection: Converts 3D coordinates to 2D for visualization, including camera controls for rotation and zoom.


Particle Visualization: Displays particles based on their probability density and position.


Realism and Novelty: The physics seems classical (gravity, collisions), but the visualization of a quantum wave function in this context is unique. The treatment of the wave function as a collection of particles influenced by gravity is not physically accurate for quantum systems, but it's a novel way to visualize these concepts.


This code is more a creative exploration than a physically accurate simulation. It combines elements of quantum and classical physics in an innovative way, which is interesting for educational or artistic purposes. For rigorous physical simulation or novel physics discoveries, the model would need to adhere closely to established physical laws and principles.
